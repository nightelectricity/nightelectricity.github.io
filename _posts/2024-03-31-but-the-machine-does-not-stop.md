eventually you are left with yourself

shards of microchips and bone under your skin

and her, lying there

amongst the wreckage of you

<span class="green">but the machine does not stop</span> 

the violent cartharsis of your being

expressed in markdown files and avatars

is different to this

<span class="cred">new</span>

<span class="credb">everyday</span>

<span class="credc">brutality</span>

an attempt to cradle your soul in a world of knives

<span class="green">but the machine does not stop</span> 

it is hard to know how strong you are when you <span class="red">hurt</span> so much

past and present clawing at your insides as the world crumbles

beneath you

beneath her

and your fury is not enough to shield you

<span class="green">but the machine does not stop</span> 

bionic angel cursed to rot in meat space

flesh for the vultures of common sense values

beyond the salvation of a corpse country

<span class="red">but the machine WILL NOT STOP</span> 

and you are still here
<br><br>
<span class="cgreen">
AND IF YOUR </span><span class="bigred">LOVE</span><span class="cgreen"> WILL NOT DESTROY THE WORLD</span>

<span class="cgreen">
IT WILL FUCKING OUTLAST IT</span>

<span class="cgreen">
AN IDOL FUELLED BY SPITE</span>


<span class="cgreen">
AND </span><span class="bigred">BLOOD</span>

<span class="cgreen">
A MACHINE DYKE MONUMENT</span>

<span class="cgreen">
TO A DEATH THAT NEVER CAME</span>
<br><br> <br><br> 
and never will
<br><br> <br><br> <br><br> <br><br> 
<span class="green">[elliedee](meat-space.html)></span> take care of yourself
