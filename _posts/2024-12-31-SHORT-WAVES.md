# candle
![poem with a memento mori skull background with trepanation tools overlayed.
"the candle burns
in your trepanned skull
smoky reek of tallow
dripping through dura mater
don't chafe gainst your bonds
the wax will make you better
valleys of aberrant thought
filled
cleansed
silenced
lids fused open by leaking fuel
eyes forever forward
forever obedient
a perfect automata 
til' the light is snuffed out".](/assets/images/candle.png)

# lunar
![every night i can feel myself losing grip on the world, i was born with veins full of moondust and the moon will take me yet, i stare up at it at and my heels wrench free of the ground, my spine pulled by its haunting gravity, dreams of drifting through the cold black, pockmarked with dead stars, and of me, lunar, of the moon, melded into the rock as an orbital ossuary, never to be heard from again, a glint in a child's telescope](/assets/images/lunar.jpg)

# nail in the coffin
![they lowered me into a casket,
we must remove the worms,
they said.
then you can live forever.
my flesh, fatless and dehydrated,
slides onto the bed of nails.
my fingers scrape at the closing wood
we must remove the worms,
they said.
you must live forever.
in the dark
my tongue writhes restlessly
begging for water that does not even flow from my eyes
but eventually i feel them
the worms burrowing out of my pores
my body unable to support parasitism 
and with no other host
they die at my feet
and i will live forever
in the dark](/assets/images/nail.jpg)

# woods
![there used to be a forest
near a house that wasn't a home 
and i would walk in the woods 
briefly ensconced
from a world of knives
almost sacred
but when i returned
as another
a storm had ripped it apart
a route of torn roots
no sanctity profaned
just dead trees
the hum of machinery
and a plaque
in remembrance
of a personal apocalypse](/assets/images/woods.jpg)

# phantasmagoria
![AS THE DMT HITS HER BRAIN 
AND SHE IS REMADE
AGAIN AND AGAIN AND AGAIN 
THE WORLD TURNS OVER
MEMORIES SHIFT AND COLLIDE
MOLTEN CITY STREETS OF NEON
THE STENCH OF HOSPITAL BEDS
AIRLESS ROOMS, CHEAP PERFUME
BLEND FOREVER IN A KALEIDOSCOPE
FOR AN OTHERWORLDLY AUDIENCE
HER LIMBS DO NOT MOVE
FOR THEY KNOW NOT HER BIOLOGY
BONES SHREDDED INTO PUREE
ARMS HOLLOWED TO SERVE AS ARTERIES
BODY RENDERED INTO A PULSING HEART
DEATH WILL NOT COME
DEATH WILL NEVER COME 
AN EVER SHIFTING SHOW
FOR THE EVER HUNGRY VIEWERS](/assets/images/phantasmagoria.jpg)

# feast
![Her tongue spirals out of her mouth like a corkscrew. Let's.. She pants, dog like, rancid meat breath against his eye. ...eat A lunge forward, teeth scraping his eyelids, her tongue rammed under his eye. She fractals in bright lights as her mouth muscle grabs hold of his optic nerve: The eye comes loose, rolling about in her mouth Augh she heaves. Kaleidoscoped vomit of churned up bile forced into his eye socket. You taste so fucking bad. What the fuck is wrong with you](/assets/images/feast.jpg)

# diaphonised
![there's an anatomy model at school
with transparent skin
dyed organs and bones
and glass eyes, wet with isopropyl
she's very realistic
there's a pump 
under the teacher's desk
that keeps her fluids circulating
she behaves just like a real girl
i hit her with an aluminium bat
and the skin deformed
and spiderweb cracks 
spread across her skull
a waterfall of alizarin red
like a human lava lamp
i thought i heard a whimper
but it must've been the skin 
peeling from the metal spurs hammered into the wall
keeping her upright, unmoving
they gave me six months detention
i have to stay and clean the pump
but at least i'll always have company](/assets/images/dia.jpg)

# broom
![i sweep the graves
four times a day
the leeches hide in the leaves
they burrow through rotten wood
trying to eat our dead 
in autumn i can hear their screams
from beyond the veil
and when i cannot sleep
i take the knife 
fashioned from a fence post
and peel a piece of my leg
to toss to the ravenous horde
a pound of flesh 
for a moment of silence
and the hope 
that they'll gain a taste 
for the living](/assets/images/broom.jpg)

# scarecrow
![shiplog_1313
set out another satellite today
they're going offline 
quicker and quicker
whatever's out there is catching on
but the decision is already made
losses are acceptable 
we have to keep setting them out
this one's name was colin
he worked in the mines
lungs barely functioning
filled with silicates
harder to fit the oxygen tubes
but we managed
he didn't resist
he was happy for the opportunity
to commute his sentence
he will join the other scarecrows
at the edge of the milky way
may we never have to know
whatever he will see](/assets/images/1.png)

# disguise
![please i don't want to be seen anymore i don't to go out there my face doesn't belong here doesn't belong on my body but i can't get it off i can't scrape it from my skull when people see me they should see right through me, a hole bored through my head, a window to the cold death world with me in it, even a mask draws too much attention, it is just another face and another face does no good i want the negation of face of identity i want to be disguised from this plane of reality i want to live lonely i want to be a ghost that only exists in photographs i take i want to only be the self i have constructed i do not want to be perceived i do not want this i do not want this 
i do not want this i do not want this
i do not want this i do not want this](/assets/images/disguise.jpg)


# slash
![i pin his shoulders to the floor and run my finger across his teeth. wet. panting. desperate. i do not let him touch me or service himself. his fledgling wings flutter as i scrape my knife across his ribs, feeling his shortening breath in the vibrations of the handle. savour the anticipation
then
puncture.
the key is to cut against the grain. i shove my cock into his unfurling guts as he cums. too soon. bad boy. you'll never get the heaven that way.](/assets/images/slash.jpg)

# alone
![the wretch walks home, alone, the
trees only visible through long exposure, sniffling but it's probably just the cold, arms dragging across
the asphalt, plodding footsteps taking it no closer to home, already 
discarding the trinkets .
that would bring questions at the doorframe
a light comes. over the hill.
a car driven by shadowed head. the wretch flinches, hands before its sunken face, headlights flaring through glass, clawing tires briefly piercing through the howling winds
of the tarmac blasted heath, and do the shadowed eyes see it, slinking in the dark, and
does the wretch consider
the leap
before the light fades
into the lonely winter](/assets/images/alone.jpg)

# mirror image
![An edited photo of a person with curly hair reflected in a smashed mirror. A horde of people crowding together lit by CRT phosphors crawl in the persons silhouette. Text reads sometimes it breaks](/assets/images/mirrorimage.jpg)

# shadow
![he candle flickers, unnatural
i see something
dancing
on the cabin walls
churning in the woodwork
man nor beast
could nary cast
such a fearful apparition
i dare not avert my gaze
behind my eyes i can 
sense it
peeling from the rot
grand sinews of ichor
just barely anchoring it
to some
antediluvian arena
beyond these walls
beyond the firmament
yet it is
just a shadow
as the candle burns
just a shadow
as the cup drains
just
a
shadow](/assets/images/shadow.jpg)

# grotesque
![Heavily distorted repeated image of a rusty hammer layered with blood, a weird figure appearing in the haze.](/assets/images/grotesque.jpg)

# haunted house
![it is october 
2017
and i don't know where i am
the smell of manure at 36 degrees
sweat stinging at my eyes
its the humidity that gets you 
and an old family estate
abandoned
walls rotted or burned
i almost step across
but my friend screams at me
its an altar
dont cross the threshold
as i retreat
we see a light flicker on
and we run until our lungs give in 
and i will translate this memory  
forever](/assets/images/hauntedhouse.jpg)

# cider
![a clump of your rotting hair comes off in my hand
your head wound a compost bin
i want to preserve us
not in amber but cider
i want to drink
in this locked room
til i cant move for the cans
and spilt alcohol coats
the floor
my skin
i want the flies to like me
before i become a corpse 
and for the world to find us
floating 
fermented
frozen
a sideshow
attraction
perfect
dead girls
for a rotten
dead world](/assets/images/cider.jpg)

# possession
![there are so many hands
beneath your skin](/assets/images/possession.jpg)

# cozy
![Fake 4chan post
692548137
be a neet
browsing the vidya and drinking dr pepper
cozy as fuck
bitch wagie mom knocks on the door
anon im worried about you
tell her to fuck off she starts crying
doesnt understand im getting cozy with the bros on a friday night
she still wont shut up
i get up open the door
her face is disgusting tears and snot dribbling down her face
standard boomer femoid ranting
i give her a little push
her body bounces down the stairs like a GTA4 ragdoll
arthritic bones break and splinter out her skin
throat clogged with blood shes finally quiet
i take her phone out and use her mangled face to unlock it
dumb cunt has left her bank account open
mfw i can have all the treats i want
mfw i can be cozy forever
did i win bros](/assets/images/cozy.jpg)

# labyrinth
![sometimes i walk aimless through streets of concrete 
soul above my body cold automatic and though i stop it never ends](/assets/images/labyrinth.jpg)

# miasma
![leechbound daughter of sodom
miasma leaking from your pores
death will not take you
for you are bringer of death
more sores than skin
bubbling plague welts 
and veins full of phlegm
vials of your putrefaction
serve as a perfect weapon
so you will be kept
infected
infested
infernal](/assets/images/miasma.jpg)

my hands
in you 
as you

like
water

# resurrection 
![An open, grinning mouth amongst pistons, monochrome.](/assets/images/resurrected.jpg)

# foliage
![i will find you in the trees](/assets/images/foliage.jpg)

# hex
![the fear takes longer to set in than you'd think, stood on the precipice of your own mortality, the past clawing at your brain, dizziness of vertigo drowned by the relief that everything could be resolved in one simple motion, and yet you linger, and exit bag tutorials and catch the bus chatrooms become what they always were, a joke, a balm to deal with the untenable, a reality easier to swallow than the idea that this would be forever, that it wouldn't actually get better, that you're not even cursed, that this is a banal kind of hell, the same one for everyone, that there is no black bile coursing through you that can be expelled through violence or otherwise, and it would be only much later that you understand that there isn't actually something wrong with you but it's too late for your past self, your hexed self, and though you try to come to terms with what happened to that other you they are too distant, too frightened too alone in a world they don't realise they can break from, a shadowed existence of being ready to jump but thankfully never managing it.](/assets/images/hex.jpg)

# memento mori
![in the park
there's a path
obscured by trees
the only human touch
discarded needles
and crisp packets
you can almost pretend 
you're alone
and yet
there's one tree
surrounded with bouquets
sodden with rain
inked grief 
running into the soil 
and you, stood
in the memory
of a strangers favourite place](/assets/images/mori.jpg)

# illusion
![A gigantic angel intersected by a rainbow, reflected in the water. i have to believe that this isn't real](/assets/images/illusion.jpg)

# tomb
![FOR YOUR CRIMES
i walk alone on this dead rock
YOUR CONSCIOUSNESS WILL BE EJECTED
senses cut off by metal skin
BROADCAST INTO A MINING ROBOT
tomb body for a tomb planet
TO WORK ON THE PLANES OF MARS
i lie on the mound of machine corpses
UNTIL YOUR SENTENCE ENDS
and wait for my batteries to run out](/assets/images/tomb.jpg)

# hayride
![HAUNTED HILL FARM
HOME OF THE HARROWGATE HAMMER MURDERS
The hammer drove the nail
into Grahams tongue, nine 
inches of rusted metal
piercing through flesh, bone.
The claw entered his hard 
palate, spilling his teeth
all over the grass.
CAN YOU FIND THEM ALL?](/assets/images/hayride.jpg)

# devilish
![Edited witch hunting pamphlet. "Though the water fills my lungs and you could never find my horns I will see you in Hell yet, Christian man, your empire of hate will crumble at your feet, stained glass mere sand in your rotting fingers, and you will know all your evils as the fire consumes you"](/assets/images/devilish.jpg)

# halloween party
![I WILL GOUGE YOU above a carved pumpkin](/assets/images/party.jpg)

# fight or flight
![the response fails to kick in.
the box cutter gets closer 
and closer
to your teeth. 
she smiles at you as she extends the blade
and you do not move
even as the tip
goes between your incisors
scraping the enamel
blood bursting from your gums
and she tells you
she loves you.](/assets/images/fightorflight.jpg)

# self surgery
![the rot wont remove itself](/assets/images/selfsurgery.jpg)

# decay
![i used to fill my veins with iodide
to protect against your reactor
but now i hold your rust
against my burning skin
geiger clicks a heartbeat
and though my teeth
waterfall in blood
down my breast
i will live in this wreckage
even if it is a half life
and slough into you
my star of wormwood](/assets/images/decay.jpg)
