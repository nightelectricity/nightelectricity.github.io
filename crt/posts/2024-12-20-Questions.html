<li>why do you have two websites isn’t that excessive</li>
</ol>
<p>
I have more than two! You can still view the old version of <a href="https://nightelectricity.neocities.org/">Night Electricity on Neocities</a>, and there are many older worse ones besides. I’ve always liked writing and being a database animal so websites have always been fun for me. The reason I started this one is because there were so many times this year that I wanted to write something longer than a social media post and less formal than an essay, and also I missed the scrappier nature of <a href="https://zonelets.net/">Zonelets</a>. Any pressure I put on Night Electricity seems entirely self imposed, but it’s also presentationally imposed! But I didn’t want to tear down the site that I gave myself stress migraines over, so here is a little nested one, with the benefit for me that I can edit it all on my desktop, and the benefit to you that I almost know what I’m doing now. So maybe it’s one website?
